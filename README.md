Assignment 5: Decorator
--------------------------------

Study the decorator pattern [1].

Get an overview of the ``java.io`` package [2].

Scan the class-javadocs of java.io classes. Which ones are suitable for your needs?
Can you spot other implementations of the decorator pattern in this package?

Write two decorator classes: One that decorates an existing Java class for 
(i) reading and one for (ii) writing character streams.

Use the following class names:  
(i) ``MorseReader``  
(ii) ``ROT13Writer``  

Make sure that each one of your two decorator classes decorates an existing Java class from the ``java.io`` package. Which class should you decorate, such that you really benefit from the pattern?

Note: the assignment is about CHARACTER streams (see above).

The reading decorator shall implement a morse code translator [3,4]. 
For example, a file containing ``.... . .-.. .-.. ---`` will be read as ``hello``.

The writing decorator shall implement the ROT13 cipher algorithm.
